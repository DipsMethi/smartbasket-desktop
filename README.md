 # SmartBasket Desktop

SmartBasket(R) a checkout system based on RFID was my final year university project incorprating Software, Hardware and Database (DBMS).
This particular software allows system administrators to manage and manipulate the model from this software. It displays all registered users from the mobile application (smartbasket-app) and displays personal details and all scanned items (RFID tags) related to each user.
